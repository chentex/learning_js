# Learning JavaScript

A little project for beginners to learn the basics oa JavaScript language.

## How it's organized

* Lesson 01: Variables basics. [here](./lesson01.js)

## How to run examples

First you need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
If you don't have it I recommend this sources:

* [Mac](https://gist.github.com/mshick/306171bf69cf6d901d1332f49b5c4e2d)
* [Linux](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)
* [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows)

Once installed check your node version, make sure you have version 6 or above.

```bash
$ node -v
v6.11.5
```

Now you can run the examples like this:

```bash
$ node lesson01.js

b = 10
a = 6
a = 7
s = this is a string 's that has stuff andenters.
s length = 45
s in Upper Case = THIS IS A STRING 'S THAT HAS STUFF ANDENTERS.
d = This is the correct way to use strings, with no breaking line.
true
false
```

> This is still a Work In Progress, I'll keep adding more stuff as the days go by.

> Any problems or suggestions create an [Issue](https://github.com/chentex/learning_js/issues) to discuss them.
